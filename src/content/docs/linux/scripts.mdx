Here's my personal selection of scripts that you **need**. 

## Recursive Git Mirrors

Mirroring git repositories is something we all need to do from time to time.
And if not- you're probably too lazy to do it so you don't (you should always
keep backups)

If you don't know how to change the push url of a git repository then <a
href="/linux/commands/#git-repository-mirroring" target="_blank">see this</a>

Here's a script to mirror every repository in the current folder recursively
and in parallel (so you don't have to wait for each one to finish for the other
to start).

<Tabs>

  
  <TabItem label="Parallel">

  ```bash title="bash"

  cd /home/fluffy/personal/mirrors || exit

  mirror_repo() {
    repo="${1%/.git}"  
    echo "Mirroring $repo..."
    cd "$repo" || exit
    git fetch -p origin
    git remote show origin  
    git push --mirror
    cd -
  }

  export -f mirror_repo  

  find . -type d -name '*.git' -print0 | parallel -0 mirror_repo
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Serial (slow)">

  ```bash title="bash" 

  cd /home/fluffy/personal/mirrors || exit

  find . -type d -name '*.git' -exec bash -c '
    repo="${1%/.git}"  
    echo "Mirroring $repo..."
    cd "$repo" || exit
    git fetch -p origin
    git remote show origin  
    git push --mirror
    cd -' _ {} \;
  ```

  </TabItem>


</Tabs>

Save the script to a `.sh` file and thes do a `bash filename.sh` and it 
should work.

This script goes through every folder is the `/home/fluffy/mirrors` directory
after which it checks for a `.git` folder, then fetches the updates from the
previous origin (`fetch -p`), then prints out the new origin ( <a
href="/linux/commands/#git-repository-mirroring" target="_blank">learn how to
set it </a>) and then finally pushes it (`--mirror`).


:::note 
You will need to have `parallel` installed on your system to run these
in parallel. Install `parallel` with your package manager (`apt`, `pacman` etc)
