## Installation

First we'll start with basic network security testing and mapping. Common tools
used for this are:

- `aircrack-ng`
- `wireshark`
- `nmap`
- `airgeddon`
- `etherape`
- `mtr`
- `tcpdump`
- `traceroute`

Its recommended that you use a debian-based distro such as 
<a href="https://www.kali.org/" target="_blank">Kali Linux</a> 
Or 
<a href="https://www.parrotsec.org/" target="_blank">Parrot OS</a> 
or if you have the balls to install a 20+gb ISO... 
<a href="https://www.blackarch.org/" target="_blank">BlackArch</a> 

> Or <a href="https://www.backtrack-linux.org/" target="_blank">BackTrack</a> 
if you're feeling nostalgic üòî

To install these tools on your computer. You can use the advanced package tool
`apt` to install these tools or If you're on arch (btw), `pacman` has all of
these on the aur.

## WiFi Attacks with Aircrack-ng

So... Now you decide you wanna test your wireless network's security. Lets jump
right into it! Tools which we'll be using for this are the `aircrack-ng` suite.
These can be used to put your networking device into monitor mode, scan for
wireless networks around you and finally.. crack them. Let's start this by
firing up a temrinal.

You will need to be a superuser/admin to use these commands so make sure you
have a root terminal open or use `su root` or `sudo su` to do so.

```bash title="Bash (root)"
ifconfig
```

This command will show all your wireless and wired interfaces for networks that
your computer has access to. You will have to select a wireless interface. The
default value for a wireless interface on linux usually starts with wl (
Example: wlan0 (standing for `Wireless Local Area Network #0`).

:::note
you will need to make sure that your wifi adapter allows 'monitor mode'
to work with the next tool. 
:::

Once you have found your wireless adapter name, you need to put it in monitor
mode to look for (monitor) networks. This is done by running the following
command:


```bash title="Bash (root)"
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng start <interface name>

#Example: 
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

This will start the adapter in monitor mode. 

So now we have our wireless card in monitor mode. Time to scan for some
networks! The command `airodump-ng` will scan for wireless networks around you.
But you will have to specify a wireless network interface for it to scan with.

```bash title="Bash (root)"
airodump-ng <interface name>
#Example:
airodump-ng wlan0
```

This basically lists all the wireless networks' MAC ID's (BSSID) and their
channel. It also lists the BSSIDs of the devices connected to it (station).

### Deauthentication

Now what you gotta do to get a .cap file (caplet) is create a handshake between
a device joining the network and the network itself. To do this you have to
kick a device off the network using the STATION MAC ID (station). and the BSSID
of the network shown next to it (BSSID). You will also have to write this data
to a .cap file for cracking later. Note the BSSID of the router, the channel
that its on and the STATION MAC ID to kick off the network. Also note down the
name of the file you want to save the .cap to. Now you will have to run
aireplay-ng while airodump-ng is running as you have to capture a handshake-
not just kick someone off the wifi.

Follow these steps and replace the respective values in brackets with the
values you got from the airodump-ng output.

Window 1:

```bash
airodump-ng --bssid <ACCESS POINT BSSID> -c <CHANNEL> -w <FILENAME> <INTERFACE NAME>
```

Window 2:

```bash
aireplay-ng -0 0 -a <ACCESS POINT BSSID> -c <STATION MAC ID> <INTERFACE NAME>
```
