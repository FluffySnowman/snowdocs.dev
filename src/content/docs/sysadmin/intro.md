Everything in this section (system administration) is writen in a way that
assumes that you (the reader) is already familiar with software and hardware.
This includes knowing how to operate a computer with only a keyboard and no GUI
along with basic knowledge of networking and things like `docker`,
`kubernetes`, `ansible` etc.

All the content I've put/will put in this section (system administration) is 
explained in the simplest way possible.
